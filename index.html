I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
were current, if not more so, in the company I joined.
I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.The next 12
weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve
successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp
themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from
their experiences was easy.
  </pre>
  <pre class="sub1">
“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The
program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present
myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the
personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”

Such a life-changing
experience. Highly
recommended!
      </pre>
      <pre class="sub2">
“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve
never written a line of code. I needed
some structure from professionals
who can help me learn programming
step by step. I was encouraged to
enroll by a former student of theirs
who can only say wonderful things
about the program. The entire
curriculum and staff did not
disappoint. They were very hands-on
and I never had to wait long for
assistance. The agile team project, in
particular, was outstanding. It took
my learning to the next level in a way
that no tutorial could ever have. In
fact, I’ve often referred to it during
interviews as an example of my
developent experience. It certainly
helped me land a job as a full-stack
developer after receiving multiple
offers.100% recommend! ”
